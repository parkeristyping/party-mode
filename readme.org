#+TITLE: Emacs Party Mode
It's an Emacs party and you're invited. Checkout the [[https://youtu.be/k-ciw_dUhGk][video demo]].

ðŸ’–ðŸ’•ðŸŽ¶ Thanks a million to [[https://soundcloud.com/crapface][CRAPFACE]] for letting me use a track from [[https://soundcloud.com/1833-fm/1833-mix-series-vol-78-crapface][this awesome mix]].

* Installation
** Vanilla Emacs
Clone this repository with e.g.  ~$ git clone git@github.com:parkeristyping/party-mode.git~.

Then, make sure the party-mode repo you just cloned is in your Emacs load path, and require the package. You can do this by adding these lines to your ~.emacs~ or ~.emacs.d/init.el~ file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/party-mode")
(require 'party-mode)
#+end_src

** Spacemacs
I'm a big fan of Spacemacs, which uses "layers" for package setup and configuration. So, I created one that encapsulates my personal configuration of party-mode. [[https://github.com/parkeristyping/.spacemacs.d/tree/master/layers/my-party-mode][Here]] it is if you'd like to take a look.

* Usage
Party with ~M-x party-mode RET~.

Go back to work with ~M-x stop-partying RET~.

* Music Configuration
You have to do a bit of configuration to get the music playback part working.

There are two variables that, if not ~nil~, get called as functions when you start and stop party-mode. These are, respectively: ~party-mode-start-music-fn~ and ~party-mode-stop-music-fn~.

They default to ~nil~, but you can set them to whatever you want to play music. Below I describe two options I've been able to get working.

** 1. Use a shell command like ~afplay~
Probably the easiest way to get party-mode working is using a shell command for music playback. This can be done out-of-the-box with newish Macs using the ~afplay~ command. The rest of this example uses ~afplay~, but it should be pretty much the same for any command line music player.

First, find a song that you want to party to, and make sure ~afplay~ is working by trying out ~$ afplay /absolute/path/to/song.mp3~.

Then, customize ~party-mode-start-music-fn~ in your ~.emacs~ (or ~.emacs.d/init.el~, ~.spacemacs.d/init.el~, etc):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq party-mode-start-music-fn
  (lambda () (start-process "party-music" "*party-music*" "afplay" "/absolute/path/to/song.mp3")))
#+end_src

Finally, you'll also want to customize ~party-mode-stop-music-fn~ so the music cuts off when you're done partying:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq party-mode-stop-music-fn
  (lambda () (kill-process "party-music")))
#+end_src

** 2. Use EMMS
Another option would be to use an Emacs media package like [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/][EMMS]] for music playback. To do that, you'll first need to configure EMMS for audio playback. Once you've done that, you can customize ~party-mode-start-music-fn~ and ~party-mode-stop-music-fn~ using EMMS commands. Here's an example, which streams some suggested party music:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq party-mode-start-music-fn
  (lambda () (emms-play-url "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/partymode/party_music.mp3")))
(setq party-mode-stop-music-fn 'emms-pause)
#+end_src
