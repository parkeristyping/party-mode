#+TITLE: Emacs Party Mode
I could describe it, but why not just give it a try instead? Don't tell me you don't like to party.
:sparkling_heart: :two_hearts: :notes:
Thanks a million to [[https://soundcloud.com/crapface][CRAPFACE]] for letting me use a track from [[https://soundcloud.com/1833-fm/1833-mix-series-vol-78-crapface][this awesome mix]].
* Pre-reqs
You must have installed and configured the Emacs Multimedia System ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/][EMMS]]) for playing mp3s.

Oh also you need ([[https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async][emacs-async]]).

Both of the above can be installed via ~M-x list-packages~.
* Installation
Clone this repository and add the directory to your load path, like this: ~$ git clone git@github.com:parkeristyping/party-mode.git~.

Then add this to your `.emacs` or `init.el` file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/party-mode")
(load "party-mode.el")
#+end_src
* Usage
Party with ~M-x party-mode RET~.

Go back to work with ~M-x stop-partying RET~.
