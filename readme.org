#+TITLE: Emacs Party Mode
It's an Emacs party and you're invited. Checkout the [[https://youtu.be/k-ciw_dUhGk][video demo]].

ðŸ’–ðŸ’•ðŸŽ¶ Thanks a million to [[https://soundcloud.com/crapface][CRAPFACE]] for letting me use a track from [[https://soundcloud.com/1833-fm/1833-mix-series-vol-78-crapface][this awesome mix]].

* Pre-reqs
You must have installed and configured the Emacs Multimedia System ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/][EMMS]]) for playing mp3s.

Oh also you need ([[https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async][emacs-async]]).

Both of the above can be installed via ~M-x list-packages~.

* Installation
** Vanilla Emacs
Clone this repository and add the directory to your load path, like this: ~$ git clone git@github.com:parkeristyping/party-mode.git~.

Then add this to your `.emacs` or `init.el` file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/party-mode")
(load "party-mode.el")
#+end_src

** Spacemacs
I recently switched to Spacemacs. To install there, you can use the [[https://github.com/parkeristyping/.spacemacs.d/tree/master/layers/my-party-mode][party-mode layer]] I created, which will also handle EMMS setup.

Note that when you upgrade Spacemacs, you'll need to move/delete the EMMS config files saved in =~/.emacs.d/=.

* Usage
Party with ~M-x party-mode RET~.

Go back to work with ~M-x stop-partying RET~.
