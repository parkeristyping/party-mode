(defcustom party-mode-start-music-fn party-mode-start-music-default-fn
  "Variable containing a function to start music playback when party-mode is engaged.
If value is `nil`, no music playback will be triggered.

If you customize this variable, you'll want to make a corresponding customization
to `party-mode-stop-music-fn` so that playback stops when you are done partying.

Here are a couple examples of how you can customize this variable:
  ;; Use EMMS to stream a song from the web (EMMS must be configured for this to work)
  (setq party-mode-start-music-fn
    (lambda () (emms-play-url \"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/partymode/party_music.mp3\")))
  ;; Or, maybe you want to start a song using a shell command. `afplay` works nicely
  ;; for this on a Mac. To do that, you can use `start-process' like this:
  (setq party-mode-start-music-fn
    (lambda ()
      (start-process \"party-music\" \"*party-music*\" \"afplay\" \"/Users/parker/Desktop/song.mp3\")))")

(defcustom party-mode-stop-music-fn party-mode-stop-music-default-fn
  "Variable containing a function to stop music playback when party-mode is turned off
via `stop-partying`. If value is `nil`, no action will be taken to stop music playback.

You will need to customize this in a manner corresponding to how you customized
`party-mode-start-music-fn`. Below are some examples:
  ;; If you've made `party-mode-start-music-fn` an EMMS command, you can use EMMS to stop playback
  (setq party-mode-stop-music-fn 'emms-pause)
  ;; Or, if `party-mode-start-music-fn` starts a named process, stop it by killing the process
  (setq party-mode-stop-music-fn
    (lambda () (kill-process \"party-music\")))")

(defun party-mode-start-music-default-fn ()

   music player on the current system and then use that player to play a song it

      (shell-command "curl https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/partymode/party_music.mp3 > /tmp/party-mode-party-music.mp3"))
  (start-process "party-music" "*party-music*" "afplay" "/tmp/party-mode-party-music.mp3"))
